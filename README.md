## Getting Started

Ensure you have NodeJS version v16.20.2 installed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node version. Run `nvm use` to trigger the .nvmrc file.

To start the development environment install the dependencies and run the development server command:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
